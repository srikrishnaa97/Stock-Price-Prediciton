        This is an end to end implementation of "Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project. Using a deep neural network 
        consisting of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) layers and the NIFTY-50 stock prices data set from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data" target="_blank">kaggle</a>,
        (up to 30-Apr-2021), the stock price at close for the next 30 days was predicted.
    </p> 
    <p>
        To predict the stock price for day 101, the previous 100 days' stock price (dat 1 to day 100) was 
        fed into the neural network as input. Similarly, for predicting the stock price on day 102, the 
        stock prices from day 2 to day 101 were given as input. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To predict the stock price for 30 days after 30th April 2021, the stock prices for the previous 
        1000 days were fed into the model with a 70:30 train-test split. Since the model requires 100-days'
        stock price as input to make the first prediction, the prices for days 1 to 100 cannot be predicted
        by the model. Same is the case for test data. Hence the model has predicted stock prices for days 
        101 to 699 (training data) and days 801 to 999 (test data).
    </p>
    <p>
        Model architecture:
        <ul>
            <li>Input size: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100x1</li>
            <li>LSTM layer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100 neurons</li>
            <li>LSTM layer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50 neurons</li>
            <li>LSTM layer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25 neurons</li>
            <li>Dense output layer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 neuron</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The same model architecture has been used for all the stocks. We see that for some stocks,
        the match with test data is very good whereas for some others the values are either shifted or 
        the predicted behaviour is just incorrect. We can conclude that not all stocks behave the same way
        and probably different network architectures are required to predict the behaviour of different stocks.
