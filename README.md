# Stock-Price-Prediction
This is an end to end implementation of "Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project. Using a deep neural network 
        consisting of LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) layers and the NIFTY-50 stock prices data set from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/nifty50-stock-market-data" target="_blank">kaggle</a>,
        (up to 30-Apr-2021), the stock price at close for the next 30 days was predicted.
